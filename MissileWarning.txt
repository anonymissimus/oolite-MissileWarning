Repeatedly plays a unique warning sound for as long as there is at least one incoming missile.
Missiles not targeting the player are ignored.
Since I think this is how the core should behave intead of playing a lone ambiguous "woop woop" sound,
this is not an equipment that would need to be bought and that might be damaged.
Designed especially against thargoid Kamikaze Orbiters (from TCAT) which appear like relatively harmless thargons,
and maybe other unusual types of missiles, so the player at least knows there is immediate danger.
